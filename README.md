# Singly Linked List Test
I built the Integer List base on Singly Linked List with some functions:
1. Show all the numbers
2. Input number and add to the end
3. Input number and add to beginning
4. Delete number at the end
5. Delete all the numbers has too high value

Just run Main class then choose your function
